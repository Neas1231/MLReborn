My doctor suggested and changed me onto 45mg mirtazapine and this medicine has saved my life. Thankfully I have had no side effects especially the most common - weight gain, I&#039;ve actually lost alot of weight. I still have suicidal thoughts but mirtazapine has saved me.\"'\n",
      " '\"My son has Crohn&#039;s disease and has done very well on the Asacol.  He has no complaints and shows no side effects.  He has taken as many as nine tablets per day at one time.  I&#039;ve been very happy with the results, reducing his bouts of diarrhea drastically.\"'\n",

      " '\"Contrave combines drugs that were used for alcohol, smoking, and opioid cessation. People lose weight on it because it also helps control over-eating. I have no doubt that most obesity is caused from sugar/carb addiction, which is just as powerful as any drug. I have been taking it for five days, and the good news is, it seems to go to work immediately. I feel hungry before I want food now. I really don&#039;t care to eat; it&#039;s just to fill my stomach. Since I have only been on it a few days, I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ve lost weight (I don&#039;t have a scale), but my clothes do feel a little looser, so maybe a pound or two. I&#039;m hoping that after a few months on this medication, I will develop healthier habits that I can continue without the aid of Contrave.\"'\n",
      " '\"I have been on this birth control for one cycle. After reading some of the reviews on this type and similar birth controls I was a bit apprehensive to start. Im giving this birth control a 9 out of 10 as I have not been on it long enough for a 10. So far I love this birth control! My side effects have been so minimal its like Im not even on birth control! I have experienced mild headaches here and there and some nausea but other than that ive been feeling great! I got my period on cue on the third day of the inactive pills and I had no idea it was coming because I had zero pms! My period was very light and I barely had any cramping! I had unprotected sex the first month and obviously didn&#039;t get pregnant so I&#039;m very pleased! Highly recommend\"'\n",

I know I have many pre cancer and thought I would light up like a Christmas tree but so far so good.  Maybe it&#039;s coming but time will tell.\"'\n",

I&#039;m good with pain however I nearly fainted with insertion, couldn&#039;t belive how painful it was; the doctor did say it is very painful for some. Well 3 months in, my periods last 11 days and I&#039;m in pain for about 15 days with random twangs especially in the left side and I&#039;m considering whether I want to put up with the intense pain and heavy periods. I&#039;d recommend this 100% to somebody who doesn&#039;t already have heavy painful periods but right now it just isn&#039;t for me\"'\n",

After 2-3 months of using this pill my skin went crazy with horrible breakouts. Now, 9 months later I still have horrible acne. If you want a pill that helps with acne this is NOT it.

If your Doctor is not doing monthly blood tests AT LEAST to see how the medications are affecting your body chemistry and serotonin levels, then you need to fire the Doctor and find one who does do his/her job the right way, and who is good at the science part of the job.

After trying over the counter products and home remedies I gave up. So my Dr at the time recommended Drysol. I used it for just a few weeks and it worked so good. But then after a few months I noticed my armpits darkening. So I stopped using it. Now about 15 yrs later I&#039;ve tried so many things to lighten my armpits and nothing works. This stuff did 100% cure my sweaty armpits and I can now freely wear shirts without the sweat marks. But it burned me so bad that I have dark scars for life and still can&#039;t walk around freely with tank tops. I guess you can&#039;t win them all.\"'\n",

By day 3 I was pratically bed-ridden in cold sweats and feeling completely &quot;out of it&quot; . I persevered hoping the effects would begin to subside but by the 5th day I had severe nausea, couldn&#039;t get out of bed from feeling so sick, horrible tinnitus (ringing in the ears) and felt spaced out to the point that I began to wonder if I would ever feel &quot;normal&quot; again.

I have tried Prozac and lorazepam at different times of my life. But as is commonly known, after the fourth or fifth trial of SSRIs, they &quot;peter out&quot; and actually become counter productive, even in some cases causing serotonin syndrome. But about two years ago, I was in a very stressful marriage break-up and was taking benzodiazepines to keep the lid on the anxiety, with little effect. The GP respected my wish to try Lyrica. I was and still am, after two years, astounded by this transformation. I feel like I always felt I should feel. A cessation of anxiety and a sense of well being pervades. \"'\n",

      " '\"My colonoscopy was booked in for late afternoon on a Thursday. The hospital said to stop eating anything from 1pm on the Wednesday and recommended (giving some detail) a non fibre diet from Tuesday evening until Wednesday noon - avoiding dark drinks and jelly (like blackcurrant flavour). Avoid red meat, sausages and pies; fruit, vegetables and salad; potato skins or fries, wholemeal or brown bread; nuts, pulses, baked beans; wholemeal pasta, brown rice; puddings containing fruit or nuts; cakes and biscuits, yoghurts. Preferred are white skinless meat like chicken, grilled or poached fish, cheese, eggs; white bread, pasta, rice; boiled or mashed potatoes, water, fizzy drinks, fruit squash (not blackcurrant), clear soups, tea or coffee, shredless marmalade or jam, ice cream, custard, clear jelly, butter, margarine. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nThe hospital also instructed me to start taking Moviprep, one packet (A + B) at 7pm Wednesday evening; and then another packet (A+B) starting from 6am Thursday. On each occasion I was told to drink the mixture at 250ml a time over 1 to 2 hours. On each occasion I was also to take 500ml of clear water AND to take some sugary drinks to maintain blood sugar levels &ndash; non-diet carbonated drinks i.e. Coca Cola, Lucozade, or ginger ale, any other clear sugary fluids such as clear apple juice (but NOT other fruit juices); water alone not being sufficient. A spoonful of honey is suggested if sugary drinks are not liked.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nOn Wednesday evening I mixed the two Moviprep packets (A + B) with 1 litre of water in a large jug. It tasted mildly of lemon but, because of warnings about taste, I downed each 250ml in seconds (rather than sip it) so as not to have to agonise over the taste. Starting at 7am the fourth dose was finished at 8pm. The drug started having an effect at about 7.45pm and thereafter it was a matter of getting to the lavatory frequently and quickly for about 3 to 4 hours. I went to bed at midnight but had to get up again at 2am and two more occasions up to 4am; though not in so much of a hurry. I took the 500ml of water after the final dose and about 250ml of Lucozade after that.  I was also told to use, what we in the UK, call vaseline to prevent soreness of skin on the buttocks. This I did not do but regretted it. Just before midnight I was so sore that I did apply some vaseline ready for Thursday morning and it paid dividends. \\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nOn Thursday morning I went through the same procedure again applying the vaseline again before starting. This time the emissions were yellow and eventually pretty clear. Also the emissions pretty much (though not entirely) finished by 8am, much quicker than the night before.

This medication made him confused, unable to make decisions, angry because he was confused. He became argumentative with me , coworkers, and family members. Every task he took on was filled with confusion and his ego. In 8 years I never seen him be so cold ..he was not the same person. I thought his behaviour was cause from some other medicine so I convince him to stop. Then the behaviour continued..after reading on this medicine I convince him to drop it. It had been 3 weeks since he took the medication and it&#039;s like night and day.  He is slowly returning to the man I know.\"'\n",

The energy it provides was amazing. So far the only side effects I&#039;ve had was dry mouth. Starting to get a little constipated but I knew that was a possibility so I&#039;m prepared for it.  I weighed myself today and I&#039;m down to 241. I haven&#039;t changed my eating habits and I try to stay active for at least 30 minutes a day. I&#039;m hoping to lose between 50-70lbs.\"'\n",

After gulping down as much as you can simply suck on a lemon to get rid of the taste.  Continue process and it&#039;ll be over quickly.  The second bottle in the morning is tougher.  Might be because your stomach is not expanded and chugging the solution plus two more 16oz bottles of water is really filling.  It started working for me 20min after drinking.  Be sure to get wet wipes.  BTW there&#039;s no pain with the bathroom part of it, not like an upset stomach, it takes surprisingly little effort for the bowel movement.  Good luck\"'\n",

However my psychiatrist put me on klonopin to help ease the anxiety and it has been amazing. I only need .25 mg 2 to 3 times a day, but it gave me the ability to function. Even with withdrawal from Paxil and start up side effects from Zoloft, I can still keep my head straight. Anxiety and panic are dibilatating and when I weigh my options, I&#039;d pick klonopin everytime.\"'\n",

On top of the inability to sleep despite feeling tired I had absolutely zero appetite. In the little over 48 hours I had only managed to eat a handful of cherries... \\r\\nHowever when I was on the drug I did notice less irritability and increased fatigue which I attributed to not sleeping or eating.\"'\n",

Woke up this morning still weak but I can breath out of both nostrils now and the aches and pains are finally dwindling a little. I have not experienced nausea related to the meds just the influenza has made me feel nauseated along with the many over the counter medications I have been taking. This drug works. If I woke up in pain like I felt last night I was going to the hospital. Thank goodness for this drug.\"'\n",
      " '\"Switched from deposit shot to seasonique after my sophomore year of college. My doctor said I would have one week of bleeding at the end of each pack.

But yet I&#039;m still stuck with a month long period. Not sure if I should switch bc methods because of this.

When I was diagnosed with Leukemia, my level of anxiety was at at all time high, because it also caused severe bone pain.  My pain-management Doctor had some samples of Niravam. The first week I tried it, my life was changed in a huge way.  It goes to work so quickly, if most effective and the half-life of this medicine seems short, so you aren&#039;t being &quot;over-medicated&quot;.  I&#039;ve suggested it to others with the same disorder, but sadly, most doctors have never heard of it. I appreciate a safe, effective medication and just wish that more doctors were aware that it&#039;s more effective and no or very few side-effects, so they can benefit more patients.\"'\n",

I love everything about Celexa, and would have given it a 10/10... however, I&#039;ve gained 15 pounds since I started taking it. My diet and activity level has not changed so I&#039;m assuming Celexa is to blame. This is now causing depression from the weight gain and the inability to keep it off...

In April due to infections he had a 14 Hour surgery to redo all he had done in January.    He died on Mothers Day may 12, 2013 of infection.

When I first got the shot I noticed my bleeding kept lightening up until my second shot and it stopped all together. I eat like a pig, but that&#039;s not really a big deal for me. During the first 4-5 months I lost 40 pounds, and slightly over a year later I&#039;ve gained 20 back. I know a lot of girls fidget and carry on over the weight issue, but if you exercise daily and eat appropriately, it won&#039;t turn into a big deal. I definitely recommend this to my friends who either have bleeding issues or just don&#039;t want to get pregnant. Works PERFECTLY in both cases; at least for me!\"'\n",

I took one Linzess and started drinking a lot of water, in about an hour was going and had no cramps or bloating feeling. Just don&#039;t pass gas because that&#039;s probably not what that is. Don&#039;t forget the WATER.\"'\n",

If it doesn&#039;t work well with you remove it. I have nothing bad to say about Implanon. I have had it for 6 months, I still get a period though sometimes I skip a month. When I do get my period it is light panty liner light. No acne no weight gain, libido has not changed, no cravings, no mood swings. This has been the best birth control for me!\"'\n",
      " '\"I got the Skyla TODAY. I am 21. I had my first pap in March. This is the first time I&#039;ve &quot;taken&quot; birth control. I chose the skyla because it&#039;s smaller than the mirena &amp; lasts for 3 years. I didn&#039;t want a 5 year one because I feel like having something in there for 5 years is more gross than 3 years. It was inserted about 2 hours ago. As of now, I am feeling cramps. Just like regular period cramps. When it was inserted, it didn&#039;t feel much different than a pap. I did feel a few cramps, which were pretty bearable. My legs started shaking during the process, but I think it&#039;s because I almost let my nerves get the best of me. My doctor explained the whole process before doing anything, which was good. I would recommend this product!\"'\n",
      " '\"After several wrist surgeries, I developed severe tendinitis on both sides of my wrist. For 20 years, I&#039;ve been living in pain 24/7. These pain patches basically feel like happiness surrounding my wrist. I still have pain but it is at a much more tolerable level. I have my life back.  For me, the patches work better than pain pills. They are covered by my insurance at a higher co-pay. And, with each prescription, I have to go through this whole prior authorization wait period. Get samples from your doctor to test them out and make sure they work for you. If they do, then fight the insurance. For my wrist, I am able to cut the patches into 2 halves and makes the prescription last longer. These saved my life.\"'\n",
      " '\"I was given this in a hospital ER for a migraine. One of the single worst experiences of my life. I would not wish the side effects on my worst enemy. It cause me such extreme anxiety that I wanted to pull out my IV. I felt so out of control. After I left the hospital, I had such paranoia, that I didn&#039;t want to be left alone. Took a day or two to get back to normal. NO ONE SHOULD TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!\"'\n",

I have noticed my acne has become more apparent as if all the spots have come to the surface however this is annoying I have read that the general theme is it gets worse before it gets better. I use Clean and Clear Advantage Spot Control Daily Wash in the morning and night I have so far not really noticed any difference with using this product however it leaves a refreshed tight feel to my face so I moisturise after using Aveeno Moisturising Lotion I would recommend this product however as it stops your skin feeling dry.\"'\n",
      " '\"I did a 6 week trial of this and it made me psychotic for about 2 hours once I had gotten my blood level up. High as a kite, aggressive  and talking backwards. So I went off it and had terrible withdrawal in the form of depression and suicidal thoughts. I have temporal lobe epilepsy and I think I am on the more psychotic end of the spectrum so I was more vulnerable to those side effects. I was a second degree black belt at the time. I judge all drugs by my ability to do a decent back kick  without falling over. It failed the back kick test as well.\"'\n",

This regimen slowly reduced my BP to 100/60.  This BP was too low so I stopped the Coreg CR completely. I am now on Cozaar 50 mg 1 per day and my BP is averaging 125/60-70.\"'\n",

      " '\"For the 3 years I was on it I had ravenous hunger, low blood sugar crashes, low libido, stress, and anxiety. I had just quit smoking and wasn&#039;t used to eating instead of having a cigarette. I started on Ortho Lo. I thought I was just stressed with finishing school but the moodiness didn&#039;t stop so after a few months they put me on Reclipsen. The nurse told me it was her favorite one and I wouldn&#039;t feel a thing bc it was a monophase and wouldn&#039;t make my hormones jump around\\r\\n...like they are Supposed to naturally a few times per month. Looking back I just wish I had realized it wasn&#039;t &quot;Me handling life so weak and vulnerable.&quot; It was the pill. Hormones cause feelings. BC pills have FAKE hormones!\"'\n",

But it does make me kinda have like no emotion toward people&#039;s feeling &amp; what not. Which is a downside. But I used to be afraid of big crowds. I wouldn&#039;t really want to be around people but at the same time I did because I wanted to have friends and be outgoing but it was extremely hard for me. Also I had like mild depression, always negative thoughts. But since I&#039;ve been taking it it&#039;s definitely made me more positive and more friendly. Before I would always worry about everything and when I say everything I mean everything lol. With out it I do have bad withdrawal &amp; it sucks.\"'\n",
      " '\"I took the pill Friday night and went to bed. I was rock hard most of the night. I have mild erectile dysfunction. With this medicine I go for hours. It gives you the confidence that you can think what you&#039;re going to do next and stop worrying about if its going to stay hard. My erections are firmer for some days after. No headaches or other side-effects. \"'\n",

For reference, this was my first medication used to manage my adult ADHD and I started on one pill for three days and was moved up to two and these side effects worsened with two pills.\"'\n",

I&#039;ve also noticed a bit of weight loss (not complaining) and my period, which I just got yesterday, has been very light. I haven&#039;t had any spotting or irregular bleeding.

      " '\"I have been taking this medicine for 2 weeks now and have gone from 330 pounds to 320. That&#039;s a huge deal for me because I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and typically cannot lose weight. It suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat.

I&#039;m assuming though that the thorough disgust and nausea at the sight, smell and taste of hamburger last night is because the ring has the same hormones as being pregnant. Hoping that we&#039;re not pregnant right now. Have slight acne breakout. That is all for now. We&#039;ll see how I feel after more than a week.\"'\n",

I was on 150 micrograms of fentanyl/48 hours before switching to Opana ER.  Initially I was taking 20mg of Opana 2x/day and it was not sufficient for my pain, but I couldn&#039;t handle the side-effects of the fentanyl patches (narcolepsy) so I worked with my doctor to increase my dosage and frequency so that I now take 30mg 2x/day and 20mg 1x/day.  It is expensive but I am finally able to live a near-normal life.  I play with my kids, I don&#039;t miss work, and I even keep the house up (with great help from my better half).  Opana ER has been great for pain relief with almost no side-effects!\"'\n",

In the past, i had pains in the back side of my head and Zoloft made them go away.\\r\\r\\n\\r\\r\\nNonetheless, I also had some side effects. If i take it late at night, it will cause me tension making it hard for me to sleep. Additionally, i feel like its much harder for me to climax during sex.

      " '\"My son is halfway through his fourth week of Intuniv. We became concerned when he began this last week, when he started taking the highest dose he will be on. For two days, he could hardly get out of bed, was very cranky, and slept for nearly 8 hours on a drive home from school vacation (very unusual for him.) I called his doctor on Monday morning and she said to stick it out a few days. See how he did at school, and with getting up in the morning. The last two days have been problem free. He is MUCH more agreeable than ever. He is less emotional (a good thing), less cranky. He is remembering all the things he should. Overall his behavior is better. \\r\\nWe have tried many different medications and so far this is the most effective.\"'\n",
      " '\"I used to take another oral contraceptive, which had 21 pill cycle, and was very happy- very light periods, max 5 days, no other side effects. But it contained hormone gestodene, which is not available in US, so I switched to Lybrel, because the ingredients are similar. When my other pills ended, I started Lybrel immediately, on my first day of period, as the instructions said. And the period lasted for two weeks. When taking the second pack- same two weeks. And now, with third pack things got even worse- my third period lasted for two weeks and now it&#039;s the end of the third week- I still have daily brown discharge.\\r\\nThe positive side is that I didn&#039;t have any other side effects. The idea of being period free was so tempting... Alas.\"'\n",
      " '\"This is my first time using any form of birth control. I&#039;m glad I went with the patch, I have been on it for 8 months. At first It decreased my libido but that subsided. The only downside is that it made my periods longer (5-6 days to be exact) I used to only have periods for 3-4 days max also made my cramps intense for the first two days of my period, I never had cramps before using birth control. Other than that in happy with the patch\"'\n",
      " '\"Suboxone has completely turned my life around.  I feel healthier, I&#039;m excelling at my job and I always have money in my pocket and my savings account.  I had none of those before Suboxone and spent years abusing oxycontin.  My paycheck was already spent by the time I got it and I started resorting to scheming and stealing to fund my addiction.  All that is history.  If you&#039;re ready to stop, there&#039;s a good chance that suboxone will put you on the path of great life again.  I have found the side-effects to be minimal compared to oxycontin.  I&#039;m actually sleeping better.   Slight constipation is about it for me.  It truly is amazing. The cost pales in comparison to what I spent on oxycontin.\"'\n",
      " '\"2nd day on 5mg started to work with rock hard erections however experianced headache, lower bowel preassure. 3rd day erections would wake me up &amp; hurt!

      " '\"Abilify changed my life. There is hope. I was on Zoloft and Clonidine when I first started Abilify at the age of 15.. Zoloft for depression and Clondine to manage my complete rage. My moods were out of control. I was depressed and hopeless one second and then mean, irrational, and full of rage the next. My Dr. prescribed me 2mg of Abilify and from that point on I feel like I have been cured though I know I&#039;m not.. Bi-polar disorder is a constant battle. I know Abilify works for me because I have tried to get off it and lost complete control over my emotions. Went back on it and I was golden again.  I am on 5mg 2x daily. I am now 21 and better than I have ever been in the past. Only side effect is I like to eat a lot.\"'\n",

      " '\"I had been on the pill for many years. When my doctor changed my RX to chateal, it was as effective. It really did help me by completely clearing my acne, this takes about 6 months though. I did not gain extra weight, or develop any emotional health issues. I stopped taking it bc I started using a more natural method of birth control, but started to take it bc I hate that my acne came back at age 28. I really hope symptoms like depression, or weight gain do not begin to affect me as I am older now. I&#039;m also naturally moody, so this may worsen things. I was in a negative mental rut today. Also I hope this doesn&#039;t push me over the edge, as I believe I am depressed. Hopefully it&#039;ll be just like when I was younger.\"'\n",
      " '\"I have been on this medication almost two weeks, started out on 25mg and working my way up to 100mg, currently at 50mg. No headaches at all so far and I was having 2-3 crippling migraines a week. I have lost 5.2lbs so far but note I am really paying close attention to what I am eating, I have a lot of weight to lose and if weight loss is a side effect I want to help it along as much as I can.  Now, other side effects, they are there the word recall issues exist, the memory issues, the worst of it seems to be the vision disturbances, there have been times I have just not driven because I&#039;m sure it would not have been safe. The good news is it seems to be wearing off...I have tons of energy and I am in a great mood.\"'\n",
      " '\"I have taken anti-depressants for years, with some improvement but mostly moderate to severe side affects, which makes me go off them.\\r\\n\\r\\nI only take Cymbalta now mostly for pain.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I began Deplin, I noticed a major improvement overnight. More energy, better disposition, and no sinking to the low lows of major depression. I have been taking it for about 3 months now and feel like a normal person for the first time ever. Best thing, no side effects.\"'\n",
      " '\"I had Crohn&#039;s with a resection 30 years ago and have been mostly in remission since.  Have recently had a bad flare and narrowing at the anastomosis and need to be on medication, but haven&#039;t found one that I can handle.  Asacol gave me such serious body aching and fatigue that I could not function.  Pentasa immediately gave me heart palpitations and arrhythmias so I had to discontinue it.\"'\n",
      " '\"Have a little bit of a lingering cough from a cold. Not giving me much trouble except keeps me up at night. I heard this was good so I took so I could get some sleep. Helped tremendously with the cough but then I was having bad stomach cramps and diarrhea. I hadn&#039;t eaten anything that should have upset my stomach and it didn&#039;t really feel like a &quot;bug&quot; so I looked up side effects for Delsym.  Now I wish I had done that first because I probably wouldn&#039;t have taken it. So, while it worked for my cough I still didn&#039;t get any sleep due to the stomach issues.\"'\n",
      " '\"Started Nexplanon 2 months ago because I have a minimal amount of contraception&#039;s I can take due to my inability to take the hormone that is used in most birth controls. I&#039;m trying to give it time because it is one of my only options right now. But honestly if I had options I&#039;d get it removed.\\r\\nI&#039;ve never had acne problems in my life, and immediately broke out after getting it implanted. Sex drive is completely gone, and I used to have sex with my boyfriend a few days a week, now its completely forced and not even fun for me anymore. I mean I&#039;m on birth control because I like having sex but don&#039;t want to get pregnant, why take a birth control that takes away sex? Very unhappy and hope that I get it back with time or I&#039;m getting it removed.\"'\n",
      " '\"I have been taking Saxenda since July 2016.  I had severe nausea for about a month once I got up to the 2.6 dosage.  It has since subsided and the only side effect I notice now is the dry mouth.  I make sure to drink  2.5 litres of water a day (about 10 glasses).  This helps with the weight loss as well as the constipation.  I have been reducing my dose to find a comfortable spot where I am still losing weight but don&#039;t feel like I am over medicating.  For me, 1.8 is working very well.  I also feel wearing a Fitbit has really helped.  I can track my food, water, exercise and steps - it keeps me moving more.  When this started I could barely walk the length of myself without getting winded - I have lost 58 lbs so far.\"'\n",

Unfortunately once the tablets finished the infection returned so needed a 2nd course. I&#039;m currently taking a low dose at evening to keep the infection at bay while the specialists do some tests.  I normally get every side effect going and dread taking new medication in any form especially after an horrific experience with Ciorofloxacin but the only side effect I experienced with this was itchy ankles and feet on day two but that didn&#039;t last into third day so I would class this as a minor side effect and insignificant. Good luck.\"'\n",

After 2 weeks I had some breakthrough pain, so my Dr increased my dosage to 50mg and I&#039;m still on that dosage today. For the first full year I was on this I never had pain and felt &#039;cured&#039;. As time went on, it seems to help control my pain. I do still have pain, but at a low manageable level. I take this around 7pm each evening to avoid feeling overly drowsy in the mornings. This med allows me to have a fairly normal life.\"'\n",

I am able to focus and my creative, impulsive thoughts have decreased enough to be manageable. It&#039;s a God send as I would perennially be in a state of hypo mania, which sounds great, but I was physically and emotionally exhausted. My libido is markedly lower but I wonder if that is perhaps an effect of not being hypo manic. I take 20 mg for anxiety.\"'\n",

      " '\"Hi all, My son who is 12 was diagnosed when he was in 2nd grade. We tried everything before medication. When we tried meds, the first one made him loose weight, fast. The second gave him a nasty tic that thankfully went away as soon as he stopped the med, the third worked for a couple of years and around January of last year we started to have problems so his doctor recommended Daytrana. It has been wonderful for my son! Easy to use, he handles this for himself each day and takes it off when he gets home from school. The patch effects last long enough for him to do his homework. He does have issues with weight gain and sleep but he uses melatonin before bed if he feels like he will not be able to shut down. The shortage is KILLING us!\"'\n",

A year ago my psych Dr switched me from cymbalta to a mood stabilizer and things were good until November as stress at work increased.  I was depending on too much bromazepam to get through the day.  My GP started me on 50 mg of Zoloft and my anxiety was so bad also tremors for 4 weeks I was sure I would have to quit working or cut my hours.  But this Monday on week 5 was amazing.

      " '\"Drinking a few extra 16oz bottles of water during the period after taking the Milk of Magnesia will help stop the painful hard stools constipation usually brings. It will help ease the release. There can be different amount of time you can expect the recommended dosage to work. For me it&#039;s best taken on an empty stomach. No food for 4 hours or more helps speed the desired effect. If it&#039;s been several days since you normally have movements it will also take longer for the effects to begin. Drink water, as much as you possibly can. If diarrhea occurs cut back on water. Take the prescribed dose, not more. Drinking lots of water along with sufficient fiber in my diet has become much easier than fighting with constant constipation.\"'\n",

Eventually, when my son was diagnosed with panic disorder (certainly inherited from me, much like I inherited it from my mother), his doctor tried Luvox for him, too.

My skin burned and was unbelievably deep red, it looked as if I had held my face up against a fire. This lasted around 2-3 hours.

I was given a card that gave me a discount since I did not have private health insurance and used each vile over 2-3 days so that it became effectively very cheap for me to use. I had side effects at first, burning eyes and blurred vision. I was told it takes a minimum of 3 months to see any benefits so I kept using it. It worked almost too well, as my eyes started producing tears so much that my eyes would water all the time.

I&#039;ve tried many SSRI&#039;s (Lexapro for several yrs) and never felt much better at all. I remained depressed and began to try to accept that this is just what my life would be. Finally, about 2 months ago my Drs office began doing genetic testing which can guide them on what medicines your body will respond best to. So Pristiq it was. I think my mood has lifted somewhat. I&#039;m really hoping it will improve even more as studies show full benefits take 6-8 weeks. \"'\n",

I took it right before bed one time and had a really vivid nightmare, so I try to take it early in the day. When I do miss a dose, I feel withdrawal more than I did with Prozac.

I got extremely bloated on this medication.  I have a flat tummy and it looked like I was pregnant which was painful and annoying.  This also gave me a very backed up system which I never get.  I got extremely nauseous, very moody, heartburn, anxiety and some depression.  The only pro was that my breasts grew a cup size.  Can&#039;t complain about that!

I think the issue was that I might have already had estrogen dominance, and the lack of ovulation made it even worse. (No ovulation means no progesterone to help your periods be lighter.)

Well it hasn&#039;t at all. Everyday I have spotting and it&#039;s gotten to the point where I have to wear a tampon every day . Every time I have sex there is always blood everywhere.

I have to say Suprep was great! Follow doctor/kit instructions exactly. Works within 30-45 min after dosing. Done using bathroom within 3-3 1/2 hours. Tips: Eat lightly 2 or so days prior, eating mainly soft foods. Hydrate yourself several days prior also, making sure to get lots of extra fluids/electrolytes. Don&#039;t drink too much right before dosing so that you can get all the solution/water down comfortably. Do drink as much fluid as you can in between doses to stay hydrated. And RELAX! Positive attitude goes along way! I would definitely use this product again.\"'\n",

For the last few weeks I have diminished my dosage to 3 times a week as I&#039;ve approached my maintenance weight goal. The weight loss has been easy.

I&#039;ve been taking Concerta ever since I was 8. I was taken off of Concerta when I was 21 and I actually went down hill after that. I lost a lot of my friends and I can&#039;t control my thoughts, day dreams and mood swings and my performance at my job declined rapidly to the point where I almost lost it. I am 23 now and just got back on Concerta and am super happy with how it has organized my mind! .\"'\n",

I was moody on my periods (nothing new) and a big decrease in acne! But now I am thinking of switching to a stronger birth control, even though I&#039;ve been on Ocella for so long and love the product I think my body needs a change in medication. I&#039;m becoming a little more irritated then the first 2 years, my nipples are especially tender after my period which never happened before. It&#039;s time for a change. Overall a great product if you would like to see a decrease in acne, no weight gain, no pregnancy scares, no depression or moodiness for the most part. Good for older teens!\"'\n",

My periods are irregular, when I did get one I would bleed for 15-20 days. It was always dark, thick tissue that I bled. I had severe cramps not only on my period but randomly. Severe 8/10 pain. I just had the device removed 11/30/17. While it did prevent pregnancy and I had minimal side effects. The prolonged bleeding, the pain, and unpredictability of getting my period made me choose to remove it.\"'\n",

I am ill, weak, have insomnia, bone pain and fever but I can do this for 12 weeks if it means a cure. I am so thankful for Sovaldi. I was very hesitant to start treatment again but I am so glad I did. My insurance covered some and Sovaldi covered the difference up to $5 per month. Thank you.\"'\n",

In the past year I can recall it happening three times. For me it still beats getting reglar periods and it has taken away my horrible cramps so I deal with it.

If I scratch the itch at all the skin turns bright red and spreads along with itching.  The itching is horrible.  3 days after 50mg increase I have all the above side effects plus sweats, chills and flu like symptoms. Have extremely strange dreams and nightmares.

I have also been taking Klonopin for as many years and it has given me some kind of normal life. I used to get the tremors so bad that the ambulance people thought it was a grand mal seizure attack. I still get these attacks once in a while but with the help of Klonopin I can actually calm myself back to a normal state of being.

No energy, emotionally feeling blah. I took the patch off to see if symptoms would improve. Overnight the achy body is gone but still have the mild headache no stomach issues so far.

I started it on a Thursday and by Sunday I had lost 6 lbs already.  Not that I didn&#039;t like losing that much but not the way it happened.  I have been so nauseated.  Now, days are not too bad but I feel like I am crashing at night and also very nauseated at night still. I cannot take this anymore. I will actually go back to the way I was, before I will keep up with this.  For my son at 81mg a day. It is absolutely FANTASTIC for him.\"'\n",

I am very happy with this medication and impressed with how well it worked out for me despite all the negative reviews. Don&#039;t let the reviews frighten you, everyone&#039;s BODY&#039;S are different so try it out for yourself!! :) good luck\"'\n",
      " '\"I chose Mirena because I was having heavy periods with severe cramping along with terrible acne/pms symptoms. I am 27 years old and have never had children. I was very nervous before the procedure because of reading many terrible reviews. First off placement was the most painful experience thus far. Not even exaggerating.  I&#039;ve got a very high pain tolerance and I thought I was going to pass out. I left the office in some serious pain/cramping and it continued for about a day. I spotted for about a week along with minor cramps. It&#039;s now been 2 months and I have not had any spotting/cramping or periods! My mood is better and for the first time in 10 years I haven&#039;t had any acne breakouts. Also zero weight gain! I love Mirena, best choice ever.\"'\n",

I have not have one single flair up at all since starting it! The only down fall is the headache that I have had. I am going to call my cardiologist today to see if I can take anything for that. I still give it a 10 even with the headache because the chest pain was worse than the headache!\"'\n",
      " '\"It&#039;s amazing how many symptoms come about because of anxiety: chest pain, chest squeezing, dizziness, light-headed feelings, feeling faint, sweating, nausea, heart palpitations. I could go on. Xanax is practically a miracle drug. It stops most of these symptoms cold after about 45 minutes of taking it. You feel better, and you look back at one hour ago, and you&#039;re bewildered that stress and anxiety caused you to feel so badly.\"'\n",
      " '\"After taking Chantix for smoking cessation I fell into a spiral of severe d&egrave;pression. I didn&#039;t feel like leaving my home other than going to work  I gained 25 pounds and felt my life was hopeless   I had always felt like an extrovert trapped in an intraverts body. I stumbled upon  Valium when my husband gave me one for muscle cramps. The effects were amazing!  I no longer felt trapped in I my prison of isolation and misery. A word of caution though: this drug is addictive and should be taken in small amounts and withdrawal should be done slowly and under medical supervision. It is a shame Valium has such a bad rap\"'\n",
      " '\"I have been constipated for about a week and tried eating everything possible that will help me go even Mexican food and still nothing. I tried Miralax and couldn&#039;t go so I tried chocolate laxatives and nothing and tried Dulcolax suppositories. I&#039;m so beyond nauseated which is better than having cramps but I still feel constipated even though I went a little. At least the Dulcolax helped me go within minutes and I&#039;m glad I was on the toilet when it happened.\"'\n",
      " '\"Used the 3 day Monistat. Intense itching/burning as soon as I used the applicator. Worst pain I have ever felt. What the hell is Monistat trying to do? I&#039;ve used before and it did not do this. I&#039;m calling my Doctor for Diflucan. This stuff is awful.\"'\n",
      " '\"I was diagnosed with GAD and PD, and then given this generic brand of Lexapro. Since this drug more potent than other SSRIs, I was relying on its efficiency to work quickly and with little side effects. I took 0.5mg of this every morning. The first two weeks I noticed an improvement in my mood. But I was feeling drowsy (a side effect) that made me lack energy and feel too foggy headed. By the third week, I was experiencing an increase in anxiety, extreme mood fluctuations, stronger feelings of fear, lack of appetite, and more symptoms of a panic attack. I talked to my therapist after 3 days of this continued torture and was advised to quit the Lexapro. It just isn&#039;t for me. Everyone experiences SSRIs differently! Keep looking!\"'\n",

My acne got worse and hurt, and my doctor said it should be helping my acne get better. Since I started 6 months ago with Nortrel I have had dry eyes and now I have a hard time seeing far away, which my eye doctor said is due to dry eyes since I have 20/20 vision. I was on Necon for 4 years and was so upset they switched me. I&#039;m stopping the pill completely now and I&#039;m worried about side effects of going off but it&#039;s not worth the dry eyes and other bad side effects. Very disappointed.\"'\n",

Before I took this, I had a lot of trouble in school with paying attention and focusing, and after I took it, I noticed an immediate difference and it was so much easier to focus and pay attention. Another really positive feedback from Concerta is that it helps me engage in conversation more because I am more focused and I don&#039;t interrupt people like I used to. Also, it helps me think things through more.\"'\n",

Vomiting, explosive diarrhea, gas pains and bloating like never before, long flatulence every few minutes (how embarrassing!), and sulfur-tasting belching (like rotten eggs).  Endo dr. said it wasn&#039;t the med.  I went to my primary doctor because I wasn&#039;t sure if it was a virus.  All of my tests came back negative.  Third week, same thing.  I decided not to take the injection and notified endo. She told me to stop metformin and resume shot.  Last week, had shot and condition worsened.  She finally told me to stop the injections.  It&#039;s been four weeks of suffering.  Not worth it!  This stuff is poison to me!\"'\n",

While it does help tremendously with the panic and anxiety, for me anyway, Xanax worked much better. I am on a slew of other meds for the other disorders I have. Just commenting on klonopin\"'\n",

I wanted to add this because lots of reviews on here say they take it at night and feel horrible all night or next morning. So maybe that&#039;s because they take it at night? Of course I don&#039;t know. But they say not to take this pill on bed rest or anything, so maybe. I&#039;ll keep ya&#039;ll updated if anything bad happens. But so far I&#039;m lovin it!\"'\n",

I asked to switch to Ortho-Tri Cyclen Lo. Since I&#039;ve taken OTC-Lo (for 6 months), I&#039;ve noticed my skin cleared up (although I still have minor acne compared to when I was off the pill), and it helped with my mood swings tremendously.

I was teary-eyed, breathing through it while also screaming intermittently as my dr inched it into place; and for whatever reason, I felt the pain on my right side. I fully expected spotting &amp; cramps for a few days after. Here I am now, just under 4-weeks later, with cramping and spotting almost daily. The cramps are on my right side, which is where the pain was during insertion. I have never had a problem before now. I&#039;ve used Mirena for over 10 years &amp; have always loved it. I just turned 40, so I&#039;m wondering if my body is responding differently due to hormonal fluctuations that come with age.\"'\n",

Did have a lot of yeast infections every month on the time of my period. Stopped taking it because my sugar got high and blood pressure was high. If you are a diabetic or have high blood pressure you have to be monitored by your doctor. This pill was not for me but every body is different. \"'\n",

My doctor sugested Viibryd after the L/C/C stopped working and so far so good.  I can&#039;t attest to the GI problems, and I don&#039;t know if I have the night time issues (I sleep like a log and am single so no one is there to tell me what is going on while I&#039;m sleeping).

Where I&#039;ve had problems with anxiety before, I more frequently have panic attacks, a rapid heartbeat, and a tight chest. I find it hard to fall asleep at night, and hard to get out of bed in the morning. Maybe the worst part is that I have a very low libido.
